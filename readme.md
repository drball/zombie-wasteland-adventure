This is my zombie adventure game, created with Twine

How this works:

Edit the project in twine (the desktop app)
Make sure the starting point is set to chapter 1
Publish file as index.html
Iteract the version number in the config.xml
Commit to git
Launch Phonegap build: https://build.phonegap.com/apps/3874384/builds
Pull the latest from git
Select the zombie keystore file (you need this to be able to upload to Google Play)
You may need to unlock the key by providing the password (char & car reg num)
Download the APK file
In Google Play Developer Console, upload the APK file
Release new version
